      <p>I am a Fullstack Developer and graduate of The University of Denvers codding bootcamp. 
         I have experience working with clients providing responsive front-end development websites.
         The work I provide is of highest quality, fully responsive, and tested in a wide range of 
         devices. I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable
         so you can enhance a website as your company grows.Often front-end development of a website 
         is overlooked, but being the part of your project that combines design, back-end development
         and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to 
         get right. My clients have found that launching with a well considered and well developed 
         front-end has saved them time and money and makes for a product that is consistently of high quality.</p>
